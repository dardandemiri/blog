This is my first post ever on my blog, and I am going to explain what this blog is all about.

Here I am going to log almost every major activities of my life like achievements, learning progress with books read, travel activities and much more.

But I won't stop here because I will not only use it for personal purposes.

Here on my blog, you will get a lot of Web Development information like tips and tricks, new technologies and much more.

In fact, this will be an Image of me, but always a changing one. Changing because of my life experience, learning journeys and all other events that can trigger a change in my knowledge and personality. And I hope it will be always for better.

Thank you for reading this first post, please stay tuned because I won't die until I have given something valuable to this Planet Earth that I love so much.

With Love, Dardan Demiri
